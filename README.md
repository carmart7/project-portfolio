# Portfolio Project

## Description

This project is a portfolio website to show off the skill set I've acquired thus far. It is built with all devices in mind for a responsive website experience no matter what you are viewing from. This portfolio will be updated as time goes on with the projects that I'm most proud of thus far. Below is a gif going through the website and some of it's features.
